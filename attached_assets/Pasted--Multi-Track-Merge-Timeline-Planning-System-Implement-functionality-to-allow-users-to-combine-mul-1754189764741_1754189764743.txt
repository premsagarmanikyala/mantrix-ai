 Multi-Track Merge & Timeline Planning System

Implement functionality to allow users to combine multiple roadmaps (tracks) into one unified roadmap with intelligent scheduling options.

ðŸ”§ Backend Instructions:
Endpoint:
POST /api/v1/roadmap/merge
Input:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "roadmap_ids": ["rmp_001", "rmp_002"],
  "schedule_mode": "none" | "auto" | "manual",
  "calendar_view": true
}
Behavior:

Identify shared branches between selected roadmaps and deduplicate

Preserve all core videos from each roadmap

Merge optional videos intelligently (based on title + tags)

Recalculate total duration

Maintain customized_from lineage

Store final merged roadmap with proper user ownership

If schedule_mode = "auto":

Generate a 30/60/90-day calendar plan based on daily study hours

If schedule_mode = "manual":

Allow frontend to assign specific dates per branch/module

Output Format:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "merged_roadmap": {
    "id": "rmp_merged_xyz",
    "title": "Full Stack + Data Analyst",
    "branches": [...],
    "total_duration": 14000,
    "calendar": { "2025-08-05": [...], ... }
  }
}
Save Result:

New roadmap is persisted in PostgreSQL with merged_from and customized_from fields populated

ðŸ“± Frontend Enhancements:
On roadmap creation screen, allow user to:

Select multiple tracks from dropdown/search

Choose schedule mode (none, auto, manual)

View calendar timeline (if enabled)

Calendar view:

Weekly/monthly grid with videos assigned per day

Progress bars inside calendar blocks

Color-coded by core/optional

Editing:

Drag-and-drop module reshuffling (optional, in later version)

Toggle view: Tree | Calendar

ðŸ§  Smart Logic to Include:
Prevent duplicate video titles across merged paths

Prioritize core videos in early part of calendar

Auto-suggest study blocks (e.g. 60 mins/day default unless user overrides)

Ensure fallback if OpenAI quota is hit

âœ… Deliverables:
Merged roadmap builder

Schedule planner (optional)

Full backend + frontend + visualization support

Saved in userâ€™s roadmap library
