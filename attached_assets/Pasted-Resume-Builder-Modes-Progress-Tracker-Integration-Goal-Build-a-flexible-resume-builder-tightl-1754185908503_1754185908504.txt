Resume Builder Modes + Progress Tracker Integration
🎯 Goal
Build a flexible resume builder tightly integrated with user progress on roadmaps, supporting three modes:
•	Study Mode
Resume updates automatically based on completed modules only. Encourages finishing lessons before resume entry.
•	Fast Mode
Resume generated instantly from the selected roadmap (including incomplete modules). Enables applying for jobs while studying. Editable final resume.
•	Analyzer Mode
Users upload an existing resume + job description. System provides an ATS-friendly score and suggests roadmap improvements.

🛠️ What to Build
1. Backend API Endpoints
•	POST /api/v1/resume/generate
Input: { user_id, mode: "study" | "fast" | "analyzer", roadmap_id?, completed_modules?, existing_resume?, job_description? }
Output: { resume_text, score? }
•	Logic:
o	Study Mode
Use completed_modules to build resume content from only finished lessons/branches.
o	Fast Mode
Use entire roadmap content regardless of completion.
o	Analyzer Mode
Parse uploaded resume + JD, score match, suggest missing roadmap modules.

2. Data Model & Storage
•	Track user progress: modules marked completed
•	Store resumes per user per mode (draft/final)
•	Store job descriptions for analyzer mode

3. AI Integration
•	Use GPT-4 prompt template to generate resume content from roadmap keywords, skills, and progress
•	Use AI to parse and compare resume and JD for Analyzer Mode

4. Tests
•	Unit and integration tests covering resume generation and scoring
•	Edge cases: no completed modules, empty roadmap, invalid resume/JD uploads
